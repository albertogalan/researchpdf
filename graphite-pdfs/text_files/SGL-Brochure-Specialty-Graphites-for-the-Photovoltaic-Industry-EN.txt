Size matters
Silicon-based solar cells promise to be a cornerstone for the power supply
by sustainable energy sources. To cover the increasing demand, economy
of scale counts. Thanks to the world's largest cold isostatic press with a diameter of 1800 mm, height of > 2000 mm and a maximum pressure of 2000 bar,
we are able to press green carbon bodies in various geometries and grades.
This is just one of our smart solutions along the entire PV value chain from
the heat treatment to coating and purification of finished parts and a way
to support the world with safe energy.

Solutions for polysilicon production
Surviving the process
Material components in fluidized bed/Siemens reactors and
STC-TCS converters are subjected to temperatures up to
1000 °C (1800 °F) and highly corrosive environments. Our graphite
specialties are extremely resistant to heat and corrosion and
increase the yield of the processes.
Solution pool
We have been supplying polysilicon producers with a wide range
of engineered solutions for many years including purified electrodes for polysilicon deposition, heaters, gas ducts for STC-TCS
converters, heat shields and thermal insulation components.
The applied materials are SIGRAFINE isostatic, extruded and
vibration molded graphite, SIGRATHERM graphite rigid felts,
SIGRABOND carbon fiber reinforced carbon and SIGRAFINE SiC
coating.
Customizing shape, size and surface
Our experts select the best materials for our comprehensive
portfolio and manufacture custom-tailored products. With
our shaping and connecting solutions, for example, we supply
converter insulation in virtually any length and diameter. To
increase the service life of highly stressed components – like
those in converters – we offer special silicon carbide (SiC)
coatings.

Solutions for silicon crystal pulling
The hot zone challenge
All processes used to grow monocrystalline silicon ingots
operate at high temperatures in aggressive environments –
like CZ-growth of PV-grade silicon ingots with silicon vapor
as corrosive gas. This is why the hot zones of industrial crystal
growth furnaces are generally equipped with heat and corrosion resistant graphite components.
Broad range of materials for monocrystalline silicon ingot
pulling
We produce materials for a wide range of typical parts, including heaters, crucibles, reflectors and heat shields made from
high-strength, homogeneous fine-grain graphite (SIGRAFINE)
or carbon-reinforced carbon (SIGRABOND), as well as insulation components in either rigid or soft felt (SIGRATHERM) and
SIGRAFLEX foil. Our experts rely on decades of experience to
select the best materials at the highest purity to fit into every
type of crystal-growing furnace.
↑ Support crucible made from SIGRAFINE isostatic graphite

Optimizing the furnace design
Together with our Modelling and Simulation Group we offer
thermomechanical and gas-flow dynamics optimization of
crystal growth furnaces. The overall consideration of the CZ
hot zones allows us to select the right material and to design
customized solutions. In this way we support our customers
with innovative products and minimize their total cost of
ownership.

Solutions for wafer trays in PECVD reactors
Precise positioning
The homogeneity of functional thin-films grown by PECVD is
critical for the efficiency of the solar cell and can be affected
if the position of the silicon wafer in the PECVD reactor is not
exact. To avoid this, we developed precision-made carrier systems from dimensionally stable specialty graphite for carrier
boats and carbon fiber-reinforced carbon for wafer trays.
Batch furnaces
To increase the number of plates per carrier boat and to ensure
low pump-down times, the flexural strength of the graphite
material has to be high and the open porosity should be low.
Moreover, isotropic material properties are important for a
homogeneous heat distribution at the plates. Our material
grades SIGRAFINE R6510 and R6520 perfectly fulfill these material requirements. Boats with graphite plates made of these
materials are used to deposit high-end antireflection and PERC
layer stacks.
Continuous furnaces
Rigidity and light weight are crucial material parameters to
guarantee a stable electrode distance within the plasma reactor. The high Young’s modulus and low weight of our carbon
fiber reinforced carbon grade SIGRABOND Standard reduces the
bending of the carrier. At the same time, the woven structure
of this grade enables an easy machinability of the carriers and
supports the adhesion of the deposited layers on the CFRC surface. The combination of these properties makes it possible to
produce slender wafer trays with a complex geometry for the
double-sided deposition of functional PERC and heterojunction
layers.

SIGRAFINE® fine-grain graphites
We produce several isostatic graphite grades, each with
distinct properties that make them ideally suited for specific
application environments.
R6300/CZ3 is our grade for graphite heaters. The electrical
resistivity is constant at high temperatures above ~ 1000 °C,
which is beneficial for use in electrical circuits.
R6340 and R6500 are proven work horses when it comes to
multiple uses of isostatic graphite. Both grades are used
around the world for various parts, including crucibles, fixtures, electrodes or others. The main difference between both
grades is the density and grain size, which results in a different
thermal expansion and conductivity.

R6510/CZ5 has become an industry standard when parts are
subjected to Si-O gaseous environments. Crystal heat shields
and funnels made of R6510 have proven to show long service
life and low dusting behavior in CZ hot zones and enable high
crystal quality.
Our newly developed grade R6520/CZ5.2 exhibits material properties in the range between R6500 and R6510. It has proven to
deliver an outstanding and reproducible performance since the
market launch.
R6650 is a high-density grade for even more demanding applications in aggressive media, such as molten silicon or gaseous
silicon-oxide.

SIGRAFINE® SiC Coating
High resistance – excellent conductivity
SIGRAFINE SiC coating is a dense, wear-resistant silicon carbide
coating. It exhibits high corrosion and heat resistant properties
as well as an excellent thermal conductivity. We apply SiC in
thin films onto graphite using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
techniques.

Extended service life of graphite and C/C components
The coating improves the surface quality and increases the
process efficiency, thus reducing overall operating costs for
our customers. Our coating extends the service life of graphite
components, increases the resistance against oxidation and
achieves the high purity required in processing PV-grade silicon
crystals.
Wide range of applications
We supply SiC-coated products made from high-strength
isostatic graphite and carbon fiber-reinforced carbon. These
include components for fluidized-bed reactors and STC-CTS
converters, as well as reflectors for CZ units.

SIGRABOND® carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (C/C)
For lightweight, rigid and durable structural parts
Our SIGRABOND carbon fiber-reinforced carbon materials show
a very high mechanical load bearing capacity at a very light
weight. They are extremely resistant against corrosion and
demonstrate high thermal stability.
A variety of grades for different applications
We produce C/C plates in three different grades: SIGRABOND
Standard, Premium and Performance. SIGRABOND Standard
plates are used for wafer-carriers in PECVD systems and
guarantee a constant and precise positioning of the wafer in
the deposition reactor.
Efficient protection
We also produce rotationally symmetrical components, such
as crucible susceptors and tubes, from our grade SIGRABOND
