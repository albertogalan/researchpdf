Smoother motion
The friction coefficient µ compares the ratio of friction force, required to
move two surfaces against one another, to a normal force (e.g. weight),
acting on the surface. The lower it is, the better the sliding behavior. Here
our SIGRAFINE EK60 graphites boast an exceptional value, significantly
lower than that of other materials: µ = 0.069 (for comparison: µ = 0.15 – 0.7
for steel on steel). This delivers decisive advantages in many mechanical
applications, such as for rotary vane pumps. Advantages include:
reduced energy consumption, environmentally friendly because no
lubricants needed, noise reduction … Our specialty graphites prove they
are outstanding motion facilitators.

SIGRAFINE
materials and
their properties
®

Outstanding mechanical, thermal and chemical
properties - foremost its self-lubricating behavior –
make our specialty graphite the go-to choice for a
multitude of mechanical-engineering applications.

SIGRAFINE seal ring

The motion facilitators | Typical properties

A manufacturing process that generates quality
The outstanding properties of our SIGRAFINE graphite and
carbons – gliding ability, electrical conductivity, corrosion and
thermal resistance, among others – can be attributed to the
depicted production process. Seven phases, from high quality
raw material to product, ensure consistent composition of the
crystalline graphite structure; targeted changes to the process
steps and the formula make it possible to influence the behavior
of the material according to need.

Manufacturing process

2

Increased cost-effectiveness: PTS technology
We can implement pressed-to-size technology (PTS) in many
areas: Near-net-shape pressings make it possible to manufacture complex component parts in large numbers at low
materials usage. Since mechanical end machining is entirely or
largely unnecessary, this process is especially cost-efficient.
Impregnation for optimized properties
Metal, phosphate, and synthetic resin impregnations improve
physical properties and reduce wear. We impregnate our
SIGRAFINE special graphite with synthetic resins, salts and
saline solutions, as well as with metals such as antimony
and metal alloys such as bronze.

All carbon – the ultrapure alternative
For applications in which no foreign substance can come into
play due to health and environmental considerations, or for
technical reasons, our product lineup includes a variety of
coked carbon featuring specific advantages: They are free
of metals, have enhanced chemical resistance, and are distinguished by higher temperature resistance than materials
impregnated with synthetic resin.
Here the self-lubricating property of graphite especially comes
into effect, since contamination from lubricants can be ruled
out from the start.

Low wear and long-term stability
Our die-pressed carbons and graphites boast low material wear
and thereby long service life. We offer a variety of types to allow
us to respond to different frame conditions.
Application competency and materials consulting
Many factors influence wear behavior: material pairing, sliding
speed, strain, surface finish of bearing surfaces, particle contamination and operating conditions. We take a holistic view
of the tribological system, and find the material solution best
suited to your specific requirements.

Thermal conductivity – a key property
SIGRAFINE materials also boast excellent thermal conductivity, which is usually more pronounced in graphite than in the
surrounding components, thereby preventing overheating
and excessive abrasion, and extending the service life of the
system.
If, on the other hand, little heat is to be diverted, the low
conductivity of carbon-graphite provides good insulating
properties.

Safety from temperature and thermal-shock resistance
Of all known materials, graphite has the highest temperaturechange resistance. Thanks to their high purity, SIGRAFINE
materials of graphite and carbon-graphite contribute significantly to process reliability.
Adjustable expansion behavior
Good physical compatibility of the materials employed is also
relevant. To achieve this they must display the same or similar
thermal expansion coefficients. By targeted selection of formula
components, we can set the coefficient of expansion of our
SIGRAFINE specialty graphite to the values of the relevant partner
material.

recommendations

appropriate design.

SIGRAFINE counterface

The motion facilitators | Design recommendations

Counterface materials

15

Recommended counterface

SIGRAFINE is especially suitable as a counterface for
hard materials such as:
For wet- and dry-running
Our SIGRAFINE materials are suitable to both wet- and dryrunning, as well as to mixed friction applications. In dry-running
conditions, surface finish should be of a higher standard than
when wet-running, because the liquid film has a compensatory
and friction-reducing effect, even in hydrodynamically poor
media such as water or gasoline.

• Gray cast-iron
• Steel (hard), alloyed and
unalloyed, as well as nitrided
• Hard metal

Individually adjustable for maximum performance
The selection of material type and impregnation depends
on the counterface material. This minimizes wear and boosts
cost-efficiency. The thermal expansion coefficient, for
instance, can be precisely controlled in order to optimally
align SIGRAFINE to the counterface.

• Aluminum oxide
• Silicone carbide
• Glass
• DLC¹⁾-coated materials

We advise you
You can rely on our comprehensive know-how. By providing
application-specific materials consulting in advance, we help
you achieve a perfect counterface fit, thereby significantly
enhancing system performance.

SIGRAFINE has limited suitability, for instance, for soft steel
(alloyed and unalloyed), light-metal alloys, chromed materials, non-ferrous metal and carbon materials.

Successful
together
We do not just manufacture products,
but also provide intelligent solutions
with sustainable benefits for our
customers.
Close collaboration and an understanding of specific requirements
allow us to develop forwardlooking solutions and respond
to specific needs.
This has given rise to most of
our innovation – such as our
resin bonded graphite.

A formula against wear
The service life of parts is a crucial factor in
the cost-effectiveness of dry-running vane
compressors and vacuum pumps. Our SIGRAFINE
vanes, rotors, end plates and casings deliver
outstanding performance based on the selflubricating quality of graphite and its stability.
A specific application condition of one of our
customers required a material featuring especially low wear, while at the same time especially
high stability. In a close working relationship
and by tweaking the formula, we developed a
new type of our resin-bound SIGRAFINE specialty
graphite with a significantly lower coefficient
of friction and higher stability in the process.
The new material significantly reduces the wear
rate of vanes in dry-running compressors and
vacuum pumps. This considerably lengthens
the service life of the devices – a crucial success
factor.
