Boost efficiency, reduce consumption
A water pump running on bearings made of SIGRAFINE specialty graphites will run for
up to 30,000 hours — remarkable performance by itself. But our materials also offer
major secondary benefits that keep pumps running more efficiently. The benefits
are clear: graphite's self-lubricating properties let a pump run unlubricated in media
that are not conducive to lubrication. Modern smart pumps operate decentrally
and solely on demand. The low coefficiency of friction for our SIGRAFINE specialty
graphites leads to lower breakaway torques, which in turn cuts energy consumption
significantly.

Smart brake boosters
Modern gasoline and diesel motors no longer provide sufficient
vacuum power to maintain brake boosters and other technical
systems. An on-demand vacuum pump instead delivers the
necessary vacuum power in an efficient manner. The same
design is found in hybrid and electric vehicles as well.

Efficient and robust
Our rotors and vanes produced from specialty graphites or
synthetic resin-bonded materials have made a name for
themselves for their exceptional strength and very good
sliding properties. This promotes greater energy efficiency
and a longer service life for the pumps.
Economical
Pressed-to-size (PTS) technology (see page 13) reduces the
need for follow-up machining of the rotors, which in turn
saves time and money.

SIGRAFINE® specialty graphites
for fuel and water pumps
Media resistance for higher safety
Safe and reliable transportation of water and fuel throughout
the vehicle are of the utmost importance. Our specialty graphites for bearings and gaskets play a big role in this, as they
are ultra media resistant and thus highly process-reliable. This
is especially important in fuel pumps working with the new
generation of fuel/alcohol mixes.
Benefit: Self-lubrication
There are also benefits from the self-lubricating properties of
graphite: the significant reduction in friction correlates into
greater efficiency; noise emissions are also significantly cut,
which can be a major factor when as many as five supplementary pumps are in use.
Documented quality
Our products have achieved various quality certifications,
including IATF16949, for years.
Pressed-to-size cuts costs
Pressed-to-size (PTS) technology lets us adapt parts with up
to 80 millimeters of outside diameter into an almost perfect
match of their final form (see page 13). This minimizes – or
even completely eliminates – the need for follow-up machining
work. This procedure can pay for itself starting with unit counts
of just 2,500.

SIGRAFINE® specialty graphites
for commutator discs in electric motors
Higher resistance than copper
Given the increase use of fuel mixes featuring a high share
of ethanol, commutator discs made of specialty graphites
are playing an increasingly important role in electric motors
for fuel pumps. These materials are inherently much more
corrosion resistant than standard copper discs, making them
better suited as components in fuel pumps. This is especially
true when striving for compliance with safety and endurance
specifications.
SGL Carbon supplies commutator discs of pure electrographite,
produced at temperatures of approx. 3,000 °C, as well as hard
carbon discs filled with graphite components and produced at
a temperature of approx. 1,000 °C. The carbon graphite family
of materials are extremely well suited for the production of
high-precision discs. These special graphites represent a
tremendous combination of carbon's outstanding material
properties and the potential for cost-efficient large-scale
serial production. These results can be achieved thanks to the
pressed-to-size (PTS) manufacturing process. The discs are
pressed on fully automated high-frequency presses to achieve
the desired final contour and shape. Standard fire shrinkage is
then the only significant factor in determining the geometric
alignment of the press tool when working with this material.
SGL Carbon works solely with high consistency materials and
precision press feeds to ensure that we can deliver the promised tolerances. Little to no post-production machining is then
required.
Another benefit of the PTS process: extensive freedom in
geometric design. As with injection molding and die cutting,
this process also allows for offsets, fluting and profiling on the
top surfaces of the discs without expensive and time intensive
post-production machining. A broad range of design options
are available, so long as they adhere to the basic rules of
materials and processing technology. Please don't hesitate to
contact us for help in developing or optimizing your concepts
and geometries.

for exhaust applications
Helping reduce emissions
The entire automotive industry is focusing closely on reducing
hazardous emissions. Smart exhaust gas recirculation systems,
which cut the production of nitrogen oxides and lower fuel
consumption, represent one important step in this direction.
Our high-performance bearings exhibit precisely the properties
needed for those systems' crucial components.
Resistant, low-wearing high-performance bearings
Our bearings are built from graphite, carbon graphite and expanded graphite. The extraordinary resistance to temperature
and aggressive gases makes this material a superior choice
over alternative products. The bearings also run quiet and with
minimal wear thanks to the material's outstanding sliding
properties.

Manufacturing process

A manufacturing process that generates quality
The outstanding properties of our SIGRAFINE graphite and
carbons – corrosion and thermal resistance, gliding ability,
electrical conductivity, among others – are benefits of our
special production process (shown right). The seven phases
from high quality raw material to final product ensure consistent composition of the crystalline graphite structure;
targeted changes to the process steps and the formulation
needed to influence the behavior of the material according
to need. This opens the door to near-net-shape pressing,
a potential cost savings driver.

2

Increased cost-effectiveness: PTS technology
We can implement pressed-to-size technology (PTS) in many
areas: Near-net-shape pressings make it possible to manufacture complex component parts in large numbers at low
materials usage. Since mechanical end machining is entirely or
largely unnecessary, this process is especially cost-efficient.

5

Impregnation for optimized properties
Metal, phosphate, and synthetic resin impregnations improve
physical properties, reduce wear and increase thermal resistance. We impregnate our SIGRAFINE specialty graphites with
metals and metal alloys such as antimony as well as synthetic
resins and salts.

All carbon – the universal alternative
Our portfolio also includes various synthetic resin-impregnated
graphites, with the synthetic resin subjected to a subsequent
carbonization process. This offers good media resistance and
can be universal used in temperatures up to 350 C°.

Thermal Conductivity

Resistance to thermal shock

Thermal conductivity – a key property
SIGRAFINE materials convince with excellent thermal conductivity. It is usually more pronounced in graphite than in
the surrounding components, thereby preventing overheating
and excessive abrasion, and extending the service life of the
system.

Safety from temperature and thermal shock resistance
Of all known materials, graphite has the highest temperaturechange resistance. Thanks to these properties, SIGRAFINE materials of graphite and carbon-graphite contribute significantly
to process reliability.
Control uniform expansion behavior
Good physical compatibility of the materials employed is also
relevant. To achieve this, they must display the same or similar
thermal expansion coefficients.
Our broad portfolio and deep wealth of materials expertise
allows us to offer optimal graphite types for the respective
partner material. This is particularly impactful in combination
with rotors and vanes.

Counterface materials

17

Recommended counterface

SIGRAFINE is especially suitable as a counterface for
hard materials such as:

For wet and dry running conditions
Our SIGRAFINE materials are suited to both conditions wet
and dry running, as well as to mixed friction. In dry-running
conditions, surface finish should be of a higher standard as in
wet running conditions because the liquid film has a compensatory and friction-reducing effect, even in hydrodynamically
poor media such as water or gasoline.

• Gray cast-iron
• Steel (hard), alloyed and
unalloyed, as well as nitrided
• Hard metal
• Aluminum oxide

Individually adjustable for maximum performance
The selection of material type and impregnation depends
on the material of the counterface. This minimizes wear and
boosts cost-efficiency. The thermal expansion coefficient,
for instance, can be precisely engineered to optimally align
SIGRAFINE to the counterface.

• Silicone carbide
• Glass
• DLC¹⁾-coated materials

We advise you
You can rely on our comprehensive know-how. By providing application-specific materials consulting in advance, we help you
achieve a perfect counterface fit, which significantly enhances
system performance.

SIGRAFINE can also be used in some cases with soft
steel (alloyed and unalloyed), light-metal alloys, chromed
materials, non-ferrous metal and carbon materials.

The Emissions Reducer | Typical properties of SIGRAFLEX

SIGRAFLEX® APX2 –
absolute top numbers
SIGRAFLEX APX2 foil was developed to meet rigorous
demands and is currently being used in a wide range of
sealing applications including:
• Exhaust gasket rings
• Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) bearings
• Gaskets for diesel particulate traps

Unmatched performance on the market
SIGRAFLEX APX2 flexible graphite foil meets the increasing
temperature requirements in modern exhaust systems. It
has extremely little weight loss due to oxidation even at high
temperatures (typical only 0.6 % per hour at 670 °C). Our proprietary oxidation inhibitors and production process allow the
inhibitors to be incorporated into the structure of the graphite
foil, fully optimizing the oxidation resistance behavior. This is
unmatched performance in the industry.

SIGRATHERM® flexible graphite products
for automotive thermal management
SIGRATHERM products made of flexible graphite are designed
to meet the old and new challenges of mobility. Especially
new powertrain systems require new concepts for thermal
management.
We use our experience we have made in the sealing business
to develop products suited to the demands of tomorrow – in
particular in the field of intelligent thermal management in
order to support CO₂ reduction, longer lifetime of components,
reduction in energy consumption, increased safety, and
enhanced customer satisfaction.

Intelligent thermal management
Wherever heat or cold has to be managed or stored under
extreme conditions within the vehicle, SIGRATHERM products
made of flexible graphite can provide solutions – due to their
high thermal conductivity and their fast response characteristic
compared to standard heat management systems. Graphite is
suitable for heat and cold transport and dissipation as well as
for heat and cold storage.

Graphite/PCM combinations for storage
When excessive heat or cold needs to be buffered and reused afterwards, very often Phase Change Materials (PCM)
come into play, despite their very low thermal conductivity.
A combination of graphite and PCM is here the best choice:
Graphite/PCM composite materials allow for production of high
performance heat and cold storage systems since graphite
increases the thermal conductivity of the PCM and leads to
faster reaction times. Another customer benefit is the temperature stabilization leading to increased passive security.

Customer specific material combinations
Due to our long-standing experience in the field of flexible
graphite, we are able to customize material characteristics
and combine different materials in order to provide the solution
for our customers’ needs. Just ask us!

No leakage, easy processing
Our proprietary material combination and process set-up
ensures that PCM material cannot leak out of the product –
a well-known problem for a long time – and our products can
be easily cut-to-size or even pressed-to-size. Fusion enthalpy
and melting point can be adjusted by selecting the right phase
change material for the application.

Low density – reduced consumption
Reduction in energy consumption goes in line with weight
reduction of the entire vehicle: due to the low density of
flexible graphite, solutions show a great potential to reduce
total weight. Flexible graphite demonstrates by far lower
densities than standard materials like aluminum or copper.

(Less e)mission possible
The recirculation of partially combusted exhaust
gases reduces fuel consumption and emissions.
This makes an important contribution to more
environmentally friendly mobility. At the same time,
the higher temperatures needed in this function
pose significant challenges for the used parts.
With this in mind, we developed a material for use in
valves for exhaust gas recirculation systems that is
precisely tailored to these ambient conditions: our
specialty graphite SIGRAFINE V2064. It is extremely
oxidation resistant and stable over long periods even
at temperatures up to 600 °C.
This product is our reaction to a stated need on the
part of our automotive customers. Beyond this, our
use of pressed-to-size (PTS) technology allows us to
deliver parts that are almost perfectly matched with
their final form, reducing the need for post-production machining. This saves time and money – and is a
good example of our intelligent, application-focused
solutions.
