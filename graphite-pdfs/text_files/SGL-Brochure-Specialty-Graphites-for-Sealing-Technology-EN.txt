Safety provided by quality
SIGRAFLEX flexible graphite and yarn products are characterized by their high standard of quality. The proven quality of our
materials considerably enhances process reliability.
Resistance and long-term stability
Products made of SIGRAFLEX are chemically resistant against
the vast majority of media, and largely against radiation too.
Furthermore, our graphite foils and sheets boast sealing properties with long-term stability of temperatures up to approx.
550 °C (1022 °F) which, depending on type of installation, is far
above other materials. These aspects are also advantageous
when sealing highly volatile gases such as hydrogen, even at
very low temperatures of e.g. -253 °C (-423 °F).
Compliance with legal requirements
The high material quality assures that gaskets made from
SIGRAFLEX products easily comply with legally established
values for emissions. We also provide many products
which meet the stringent demands of such regulations as
the Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control (TA Luft)
(see table page 17).
Reduced maintenance costs
The long service life of our material leads to a significant
reduction in maintenance costs, thereby increasing the
cost effectiveness of equipment.

7

Largest variety in the market
With our support, select exactly the product which most
closely meets your requirements from the largest portfolio
of flexible graphite foils in the world: For example oxidation
resistant, high-purity or industrial quality foils, and grades that
exhibit low friction characteristics etc.
Long-term stable mechanical behavior
All of our foils are distinguished by their long-term stability.
This is a crucial benefit and stands in contrast to other
materials exhibiting high flow characteristics which is
detrimental to the long-term integrity of a joint seal. Even
when surface stress reduces during operation, the sealing
effect of SIGRAFLEX is largely maintained.

SIGRAFLEX®
graphite foils with
oxidation resistance
SIGRAFLEX foils made of expanded natural graphite are
distinguished by their high-temperature resistance. They
are the first choice in sealing applications for long-term
use at high-temperatures.

↑ Die-formed packing ring made of SIGRAFLEX tapes for use in stuffing boxes.

Extremely low weight loss
Compared to other industrial graphite foils, our types
SIGRAFLEX APX2, BP, AP, APX and E exhibit remarkable
oxidation resistance. Their typical weight loss (in TGA test
in air at 670 °C (1238 °F) for four hours) is at 2% per hour and
less, while conventional industry foils lose up to 40%.
The lower the weight loss, the better and more extensive
is the performance of the material – making our SIGRAFLEX
APX2 foil, which, in the same test parameters, typically only
loses 0.6% of its weight per hour, the unrivalled “Best in Class”.
Fulfilling specifications
When it comes to corrosion protection, SGL Carbon offers the
widest-ranging portfolio on the market. With their low sulfur
and halogen content, our foils fulfill user specifications and are
genuine high performers in system protection.

SIGRAFLEX® high-purity
graphite foils
High-purity natural graphite
SIGRAFLEX flexible foils are manufactured without the use of
adhesives and binders. We use high-purity natural graphite
flakes as our base material. This minimizes contamination
which significantly reduces the leakage rate, as well as the
thermal and corrosion resistance of graphite gaskets on steel
flanges.

Protection from corrosion
Thanks to its very high-purity – for a part of the products ash
content of maximum 0.15 %, chloride and fluoride of maximum
10 ppm and sulfur content below 300 ppm – SIGRAFLEX foils make
a significant contribution to protecting adjoining components
from corrosion.
This increases the operating reliability and the entire service
life of equipment. Our products contribute significantly to
cutting costs in static and dynamic sealing connections, piping,
pumps, fittings, and vessels.
Our high-purity foils are especially suited to extreme requirements, such as sensitive processes in power plants.

Nothing sticks
Downtime is an extreme cost factor in the management of any piece of equipment, so incidental
maintenance needs to be kept to a minimum.
After years of use, flat gaskets often stick to
flanges, so when it is the time to replace them
it requires additional time and effort to do so.
There is also the risk of damaging the flange in
the removal process.
With ever increasing maintenance and downtime
costs, we offer material solutions with excellent
anti-stick properties for both standard and highend sealing applications saving the user valuable
time and money: Our impregnated SIGRAFLEX
graphite sheets have been used for years by many
well-known chemical companies because of their
superior antistick properties.
Our three component sheet offering the ultimate
in anti-stick properties is:

SIGRAFLEX® MF
SIGRAFLEX MF gaskets do not stick, whether at
room temperature or at 300 °C (572 °F).
The gasket is easily removed from the flanges
without leaving any residue, consequently there
is no need to clean the flange faces thus avoiding
damaging the flange during disassembly.
Users save time and money whenever a gasket
is replaced.

Over knitted wire reinforcement
The over knitted wire reinforcement is Inconel 601 which
provides the added tensile suitable for braiding. The wire also
possesses excellent high-temperature behavior and is suitably
lubricated with no detriment to the high-temperature performance and purity of the yarn. The yarn is also compliant with
the latest Shell MESC SPE 85/204 standard.
Broad portfolio of foil yarns
SGL Carbon has other foil based yarns with the same type
of reinforcement including SIGRAFLEX Z foil yarn with an ash
content of less than 0.15% for applications where a higher
degree of purity is required.

New developments in demand
We have responded to customer requests for high-temperature
resistant and high-purity braided packing yarns with outstanding mechanical properties by developing a new yarn based on
the SIGRAFLEX foil already established in the sealing market.
Maximum protection from oxidation
This has resulted in the best foil yarn on the market with regard
to oxidation resistance. The flexible expanded natural graphite
yarn SIGRAFLEX APX2, made of SIGRAFLEX APX2 foil with
Inconel®1 wire reinforcement.
The foil is made of premium expanded natural graphite and
provides maximum protection from oxidation (see page 12).
A higher bar
Our SIGRAFLEX APX2 yarn combines a number of unique properties including low friction, high flexibility, and excellent chemical resistance. Also the yarn is produced without an internal
carrier fiber and is without binders or adhesives, it does not
become brittle over time. Just like SIGRAFLEX APX2 foil the
yarn exhibits high thermal conductivity so frictional generated
heat can be easily dissipated.

↑ SIGRAFLEX APX2 yarn provides maximum protection against oxidation.

SIGRAFLEX®
oxidation-resistant yarn

Unrivalled combination of properties
Our new SIGRAFLEX OXR yarn is unique in many respects.
It has been specifically developed for high-temperature
applications, and combines the advantages of graphitized
textile yarns based on polyacrylonitrile with those of a
proprietary coating to enhance its temperature resistance.

High-purity – meets Shell specification
It is a high purity yarn with a carbon content of ≥ 99.5 %. The yarn
also has a low sulfur, fluorine and chlorine content.
This is a particular advantage for our customers, since SIGRAFLEX
OXR yarn is the only yarn product on the market that meets the
requirement of Shell specification 85/204 for graphite.

For high-temperature applications
The yarn is manufactured with a coating based on proven
SIGRAFLEX APX2 technology. Thanks to the considerably
improved oxidation resistance, it can be used in high-temperature applications. It furthermore fulfills the requirements
of packing manufacturers for low friction and high thermal
conductivity.

Yarns for unmet needs
The new yarn products from SGL Carbon close the existing gap
in the market for packing yarns that are high in purity as well
as resistant to high-temperatures.
