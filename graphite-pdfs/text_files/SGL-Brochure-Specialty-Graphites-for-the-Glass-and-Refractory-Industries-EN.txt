Specialty graphites and components
for container glass manufacture
Graphite is a very versatile material with a wide range of
applications, especially in the industrial hollow glass and
container glass industries. We provide innovative solutions:
C/C conveyor channel systems move rapidly and flexibly in
mold filling and do not require coating with a special finish/
paste or spraying with oil thanks to their good antifriction
properties. The gob surface remains undamaged.
Carbon molds combine the advantages of wood molds with
those of graphite. The porous structure stores water that
forms a moisture vapor film as the molten glass is introduced.

for using extruded graphite here are its high corrosion and
